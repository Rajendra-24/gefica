Files in this directory plot analytic results (electric potential and field
versus location) of Poisson's equation in one dimensional

- Cartesian coordinate (planar.C),
- Cylindrical coordinate (coaxial.C), and
- Spherical coordinate (spherical.C).

The impurity concentration is assumed to be constant throughout the volume.
